- **Sector:** Blockchain Ecosystem (DGP), VC / Fund of Funds
- **Focus:** FinTech, AI, Blockchain, SaaS, PropTech, Mobility

## Recent Developments (2025-2026)

### Market Context
- **Blockchain VC:** Strong sector growth
  - Tokenized RWAs: 66% YoY growth, 5B in Q2 2025
  - Hot sectors: Decentralized AI (DeAI), RWA tokenization

### Investment Thesis
- **Philosophy:** Empowering decentralization (equitable, transparent, inclusive)
- **Focus:** AI reshaping, blockchain innovation, revolutionary tech
- **Model:** Fund of Funds + direct investments
- **Geography:** Global

## Strategic Situation
- **Runway:** 3 months - URGENT but more time than some peers
- **Fundraising Window:** 8-10 weeks to close new fund or bridge
- **DGP Ecosystem:** Status unclear

### Sector Opportunities
- **Tailwinds:** 5B RWA market (66% YoY), DeAI momentum
- **Investor Appetite:** VCs backing blockchain infra (Taiko 7M, etc.)

## Risk Factors
- **Existential:** 3-month runway = must close fund or wind down
- **Competition:** 100+ blockchain VC funds
- **LP Fatigue:** Many blockchain funds underperformed 2022-2024
- **Portfolio Liquidity:** Exit environment challenging

## Recommended Actions
- **Weeks 1-4:** Approach existing LPs for bridge; highlight DeAI/RWA exposure
- **Weeks 5-8:** Target new LPs; consider specialized fund pivot (DeAI/RWA)
- **Weeks 9-12:** If stalled, prepare wind-down; maximize portfolio value via secondaries

## Notes
- Fund of Funds = dependency on underlying performance
- Sector tailwinds (RWA, DeAI) could help fundraising story
