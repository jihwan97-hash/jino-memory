## Technology & Innovation
### Archway Protocol Features
- **Developer Rewards Mechanism**:

  - Share in network inflation rewards
  - Rewards that normally go to miners/validators redirected to builders
  
- **Cosmos Ecosystem**:
  - Layer 1 blockchain built on Cosmos

### Value Proposition
- Solves developer monetization problem in blockchain
- Rewards developers for creating valuable dapps
- No need for separate tokenomics — protocol-level rewards
- "One block at a time" contribution philosophy

## Business Model
- Protocol-level developer incentives
- Transaction fees → partially to developers (not burned or to validators)
- Inflation rewards → shared with dapp creators
- Aligns network growth with developer success
