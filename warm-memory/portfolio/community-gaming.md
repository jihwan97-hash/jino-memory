## Company Overview
- **Status:** 긴급 URGENT - Runway 1 month
- **Sector:** E-sports Platform
- **Critical:** Needs immediate funding or wind-down decision

## Recent Developments (2025-2026)

### Market Context
- **E-sports Sector:** Overall industry continues growth with significant institutional investment
  - Esports World Cup Foundation: 0M funding for 40 orgs (Nov 2025)
  - PlayVS (competitor) secured funding July 2025
- **Community Gaming Specific:** NO recent public funding, partnerships, or product updates found

### Search Results
- No specific news about Community Gaming platform in 2025-2026
- Competitor activity suggests market remains active (GameCentric, FACEIT, Game.tv)
- Industry trends: Automated tournaments, mobile gaming, student gaming leagues

## Strategic Situation
- **Runway:** Only 1 month remaining - CRITICAL
- **Options:**
  1. Emergency fundraising (bridge round)
  2. Strategic acquisition/merger
  3. Pivot to leaner model
  4. Orderly wind-down

### Industry Opportunities
- Student gaming leagues (AcadArena model - SE Asia)
- Automated tournament platforms
- Mobile-first e-sports (emerging markets)

## Key Risk Factors
- **Existential:** 1-month runway = immediate crisis
- **Market Competition:** Well-funded players (PlayVS, FACEIT, Game.tv)
- **No Public Traction:** Lack of recent news = low visibility or stalled growth
- **Funding Environment:** Gaming/e-sports seeing selective funding (not broad-based)

## Recommended Actions
- **Immediate:** Assess wind-down vs. bridge financing options
- **Week 1-2:** Approach strategic acquirers (larger e-sports platforms, gaming companies)
- **Week 3-4:** If no acquisition interest, prepare orderly shutdown to preserve founder reputation

## Notes
- Limited public information suggests either stealth mode or minimal market activity
- 1-month runway requires decision within 2-4 weeks maximum
- Consider partial asset sale (IP, tech, user base) if full company sale not feasible
