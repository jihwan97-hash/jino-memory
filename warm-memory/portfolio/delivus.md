# Delivus (딜리버스)
**Last Researched:** 2026-02-25

## Company Overview
- **Status:** 긴급 URGENT - Runway 2 months
- **Sector:** DaaS (Delivery as a Service), AI Logistics
- **Market:** South Korea

## Recent Developments (2025-2026)

### Business Model
- **Service:** Same-day delivery at traditional parcel pricing
- **Technology:** AI logistics optimization
  - K-means clustering for delivery zone classification
  - Vector data from ML models for route optimization
- **Brand:** "DillyRabbit" (딜리래빗) for premium same-day/return logistics

### Technical Stack
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (ECS, CodeDeploy Blue/Green, CDK, GitHub Actions)
- **Innovation:** AI reduces package sorting time, optimizes zones
- **Vision:** "Space-capable delivery" (ambitious positioning)

### Market Position
- **Value Prop:** Fast same-day at competitive cost (vs. 2-3 day parcel)
- **Target:** E-commerce sellers needing quick fulfillment
- **Differentiation:** AI optimization (not just labor + vehicles)

## Strategic Situation
- **Runway:** 2 months - URGENT, ~6-8 week fundraising window
- **Competition:** CJ Logistics, Lotte, Coupang Rocket, Market Kurly, Baemin
- **Challenge:** Capital-intensive model, tight margins

## Risk Factors
- **Capital Intensity:** Logistics requires heavy investment
- **Unit Economics:** Same-day at parcel pricing = thin margins
- **Moat:** AI alone may not be defensible vs. incumbents
- **2-Month Runway:** Fast action required

## Recommended Actions
- **Weeks 1-3:** Approach logistics incumbents (CJ, Lotte, Hyundai Glovis) for acquisition; pitch AI as cost reducer
- **Weeks 4-6:** Target strategic VCs; consider pivot to B2B SaaS (sell AI routing tech)
- **Weeks 7-8:** If no funding, negotiate wind-down or asset sale (AI IP + contracts)

## Notes
- Strong tech (AWS, AI, K-means)
- 2 months = viable fundraising window
- SaaS pivot could extend runway (lower capex)
