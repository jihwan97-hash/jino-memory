# Fusion Point Studios
**Last Researched:** 2026-02-25

## Company Overview
- **Status:** 긴급 URGENT - Runway 1 month
- **Sector:** FPS Game (Shoot City)
- **Critical:** Immediate funding or wind-down needed

## Recent Developments (2025-2026)

### Identity Issue
- **Search Confusion:** Multiple entities named "Fusion Point Studios"
  - Reddit (March 2025): Claims "Fusion Point Studios" is NOT real studio behind PlanetSide successors
  - CB Insights shows "Distinct Possibility Studios" (2025, Delaware) developing 'Reaper Actual'
  - Various indie projects use similar names
- **Likely:** Stealth mode, renamed, or extremely low profile

### Game Status
- **Shoot City (FPS):** Zero public information found
- **Market:** Crowded FPS segment (AAA + indie competition)
- **Funding:** Gaming studios broadly struggling

## Strategic Situation
- **Runway:** 1 month - EXISTENTIAL
- **Options:**
  1. Emergency bridge (unlikely without traction)
  2. Early Access launch (if playable)
  3. Publisher deal (requires demo)
  4. Shutdown

### Red Flags
- **No Public Presence:** Zero news, social media, community
- **Identity Confusion:** Name collision or stealth
- **1-Month Runway:** Insufficient for growth execution
- **Competitive Market:** FPS requires heavy capital

## Recommended Actions
- **Week 1:** 
  - Verify company identity (correct Fusion Point Studios?)
  - Assess product: Is Shoot City shippable?
- **Week 2:**
  - If shippable: Launch Early Access (immediate revenue)
  - If not: Approach publishers (assets + team acquihire)
- **Week 3-4:**
  - No revenue/deal = prepare shutdown
  - Archive code/assets for future

## Notes
- **Identity Verification Critical**
- Limited info = stealth or minimal ops
- 1 month = no pivot room
