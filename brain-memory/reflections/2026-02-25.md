# Reflection — 2026-02-25

## System State
- HOT-MEMORY.md: 446 → 306 tokens (compressed, was near limit)
- Warm memory topics: 0 (no pruning needed — nothing stored yet)
- Lessons recorded: 0 (system in bootstrap phase)
- Daily summaries last 7d: 0 (no brain-memory daily logs yet — new system)
- Git last commit: 6 days ago (initial bootstrap)
- All 5 crons running: yes (auto-study, brain-memory, email-summary, portfolio-research, self-reflect)

## Patterns & Insights
- System is freshly bootstrapped (~2026-02-19). No interaction history yet to derive behavioral patterns from.
- No owner corrections have been made yet → lessons.md and warm memory are empty. This is expected at this stage.
- HOT-MEMORY.md contained redundant verbosity in skills section — compressed to save tokens for future active context.
- MEMORY.md (permanent) and HOT-MEMORY.md (skills/volatile) are somewhat duplicated in structure — should be careful not to let them diverge.
- jino-memory git repo only has 1 commit and only contains reflections dir — warm-memory and brain-memory daily files are NOT being synced to git. May want to include them.

## Health Issues Found
1. **No daily summaries** — brain-memory cron may not be writing files or they're being written to a path not tracked.
2. **No reflections in last 8 days** — fixed by this file.
3. **Lessons empty** — no corrections yet; watch for first owner correction and record immediately.
4. **Git stale** — will push after this reflection.

## Actions Taken
- Compressed HOT-MEMORY.md (446 → 306 tokens)
- Created this reflection file
- No warm memory pruning needed (0 topics)
- Cron schedule appears healthy (all 5 defined)

## Next Self-Reflect Priorities
- If lessons.md still empty in 7 days → investigate whether lesson-recording is working
- If daily summaries still 0 → check brain-memory cron output/path
- Monitor HOT-MEMORY.md token growth as system becomes active
